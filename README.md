üêçüêçüêâüêâ

Features:

Classic Gameplay: Control a snake that grows longer by consuming food items scattered across the game board.
Keyboard Controls: Navigate the snake using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the board's borders.
Optional Visual Enhancements: (You can choose to implement these)
Score Display: Track your progress by keeping tabs on the current and high scores.
Sound Effects: Add sound effects for food consumption and game over events to enhance immersion.
Difficulty Levels: Introduce different difficulty levels by adjusting the snake's movement speed.
Setup:

Clone or Download the Repository: Obtain the project files using Git or by downloading them directly.
Open in a Web Browser: Launch the index.html file in your preferred web browser. The game should load and be ready to play.
Gameplay:

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's direction.
The snake will move continuously in the chosen direction, growing longer when it consumes a food item.
Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail, as this will result in a game over.
Customization:

This is a basic implementation, and you can extend it further by:

Modifying the game's appearance with custom CSS styles.
Implementing different food types with varying effects on the snake's length or speed.
Adding power-ups that grant temporary abilities (e.g., speed boost, wall phasing).
Creating a high score tracking system to store and display past achievements.
Feel free to experiment and personalize the game to match your preferences!

Technologies Used:

HTML: Provides the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Defines the visual styling (colors, fonts, layout) of the game elements.
JavaScript: Encapsulates the core game logic (snake movement, food generation, collision detection).
